# Island-Perimeter
Solution for "Leetcode 463. Island Perimeter"

# Description

Given a map represented by a two-dimensional grid, where each cell is either land (represented by 1) or water (represented by 0), the goal is to determine the perimeter of the only island present on the map.

- The island is formed by land cells connected horizontally or vertically.

- The grid is completely surrounded by water.

- There are no "lakes" inside the island, meaning that water inside the island is not connected to the water around the island.

The perimeter of the island is calculated considering that each land cell contributes 4 units of perimeter, and if two adjacent land cells are present, 2 units are subtracted from the total perimeter, as they share one side
